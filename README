semargl is the complementary analysis tool for modern micromagnetic solver, i.e. OOMMF and mumax2. It offers various kinds of spectral analysis techniques, that make it particularly suitable for applications of magnonics and spintronics.

The short list of features is:

- Spectrum calculation
- Spatial mode profiles calculation
- Magnonic dispersion calculation
